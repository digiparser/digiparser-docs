A workflow is a series of tasks that process a collection of data. 
Workflows automate the tasks involved in document processing, such as document import, data extraction, and information export, to other tools or systems. 

DigiParser provides a no-code workflow builder that enables users to automate their document workflows, from auto-importing documents to extracting data and exporting it to their preferred tools, thereby increasing efficiency and eliminating manual involvement.
