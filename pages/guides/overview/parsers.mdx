A parser is a computing tool that reads and converts input data into a structured format for easier processing and analysis. 
Parsers are necessary for converting unstructured data into structured formats, allowing for efficient data manipulation and integration of other systems. 

DigiParser accurately extracts data from various document types—including PDFs, photos, scans, emails, and handwritten documents—using AI-powered OCR models, converting it into structured data for smooth workflow integration.
